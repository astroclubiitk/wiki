## Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs)

### Introduction

Active Galactic Nuclei or AGNs as they are known, are very powerful and bright galactic centers, powered by supermassive [black holes](../special%20stars/black%20holes.html). You can think of these black holes as cosmic vacuum cleaners of enormous size, pulling the surrounding gas and dust toward themselves.

This material, as it approaches the black hole, begins to heat up due to friction and then radiates light, emitting energy across the whole spectrum-from radio waves to X-rays. This is the reason why AGNs are so bright; sometimes they outshine all the stars in their host galaxy put together. They are mostly situated at the center of the host galaxy.

### Types of AGNs

Varieties of [AGNs](#active-galactic-nuclei-agns) exist, and their appearance also depends on how we're looking at them. For example, quasars are AGNs that are extremely bright and can be seen from billions of light-years away. Not all AGNs are [quasars](../energetic%20sources/quasars.html). Some [quasars](../energetic%20sources/quasars.html) are so far away that the light we see today started its journey when the universe was still young.

Seyfert galaxies are a kind of AGN, residing in spiral galaxies much like the Milky Way. But they are less powerful compared to quasars. [Blazars](../energetic%20sources/blazars.html) are [AGNs](#active-galactic-nuclei-agns) in which one of the two high-energy jets emanating from the [black hole](../special%20stars/black%20holes.html) happens to point directly toward Earth, which makes them exceptionally bright.

### Structure of AGNs

[AGNs](#active-galactic-nuclei-agns) generally have a supermassive [black hole](../special%20stars/black%20holes.html), at the core which usually hosts a mass ranging from millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun. Around the SMBH is an accretion disk, comprising gas and dust spiraling inward with the immense gravitational pull of the [black hole](../special%20stars/black%20holes.html).

This material then heats up and accelerates in the accretion disk, generating massive quantities of radiation that can cover the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to X-rays. Surrounding this accretion disk is a doughnut-shaped structure that absorbs and re-emits its energy in the infrared. Jets of relativistic particles can shoot out perpendicular to the disk and streak thousands of light-years across, emitting synchrotron radiation that is detected in radio and optical wavelengths.

### How does AGNs affect the Galaxy

These also play an important role in shaping galaxies. The energy and radiation from an AGN are able to push gas and dust out of a galaxy, either halting the birth of new stars or, in some cases, triggering star formation. This feedback loop is important, as it’s one of the ways that galaxies evolve over time.

Additionally, they can heat up surrounding gas, creating what's known as "cooling flows." Instead of cooling and condensing into stars, the hot gas around the AGN remains too warm for [star formation](../stellar%20physics/evolution.html) to occur. This again limits the galaxy’s ability to form new stars.

AGNs also play a crucial role in regulating the growth of supermassive [black holes](../special%20stars/black%20holes.html). As the [AGN](#active-galactic-nuclei-agns) feeds on surrounding matter, it sometimes ejects part of this matter outward, preventing excessive growth of both the black hole and the galaxy. This self-regulation helps keep the balance between [black hole](../special%20stars/black%20holes.html) growth and galaxy evolution.

### Why are AGNs important?

One of the exciting things about active galactic nuclei is that they let us glimpse far into the distant past. Light from far-away [AGNs](#active-galactic-nuclei-agns) takes billions of years to reach us, so when we observe it is as if we are seeing backward in time. By studying AGNs, we get a better understanding of what the universe was like when it was much younger. Indeed, some of the most-distant AGNs allow scientists to learn something about the early history of galaxy formation during the period after the Big Bang.

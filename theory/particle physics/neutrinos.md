## Neutrinos

### What are Neutrinos?

[Neutrinos](#neutrinos) are ultrasmall, electrically neutral elementary particles. By being electrically neutral, neutrinos join the family of fundamental particles called [leptons](../particle%20physics/lepton%20sources.html), which include other members like electrons and muons. Neutrinos form that group of particles present in space in abundance but very hard to detect, since they interact very rarely with matter.

### Properties of Neutrinos

[Neutrinos](#neutrinos) come in three flavors or types: neutrino electron, neutrino muon, and neutrino tau. Each is associated with a charged lepton-electron, muon, and tau. Neutrinos have very negligible mass, probably zero mass. They also travel at almost the speed of light.

The mass of the neutrino, as related to its energy, E, momentum, p, and speed, v, is given by the expression below:

$$E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$$

where,

$$E$$ = energy of the neutrino

$$p$$ = momentum of the neutrino

$$c$$ = the velocity of light

$$m$$ = mass of the neutrino

### How Do We Detect Neutrinos?

By their very nature, [neutrinos](#neutrinos) can be detected only indirectly, by observing the particles they produce when interacting with matter. Really big neutrino detectors are constructed deep underground  to protect them from background radiation from [cosmic rays](../particle%20physics/cosmic%20rays.html). When a neutrino interacts with an atomic nucleus in the detector, it produces a secondary particle that may be observable.

### What Do We Know About Neutrinos?

These are always streaming through us from the Sun and from other parts of the universe and are similarly produced in nuclear reactions on Earth, for instance, those that happen in nuclear power plants. [Neutrinos](#neutrinos) can change their type while traveling in space-a phenomenon called neutrino oscillation-this means neutrinos have a small but nonzero mass.

The neutrino oscillation probability between one type and another would have been given by the following formula:

$$P(ν_α → ν_β) = sin^2(2θ) * sin^2(1.27 Δm^2 L / E)$$

where,

$$P(ν_α → ν_β)$$ is the probability of neutrino type α oscillating to β

$$θ$$ is the mixing angle between the two neutrino flavours

$$Δm^2$$ is the difference in squared masses of the two neutrino types

$$L$$ = distance of neutrino travel

$$E$$ = neutrino energy

### Why Study Neutrinos?

[Neutrinos](#neutrinos) play a major role in many astrophysical processes, including the [evolution of stars](../stellar%20physics/evolution.html) and [supernovae](../energetic%20sources/supernovae.html). The study of [neutrinos](#neutrinos) can help in understanding those processes and enlightening us further about the universe. Neutrinos could also hold the key to understanding [dark matter](../cosmology/dark%20matter.html) of which they are fundamental blocks, assumed to constitute the greater part of the matter in the universe.

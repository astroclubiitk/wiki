# Welcome to Astronomy Club, IIT Kanpur!

## Who we are

We are a group of highly enthusiastic students from IIT Kanpur who love to appreciate the beauty of the cosmos. Not all of us have formal background in astronomy, but we are passionate about what our universe has to offer. The club is open to all the students: from the freshers to the final years and from the post-graduates to the ones doing their PhDs. The club consists of not only Physics majors but students across all departments. All you need is just a little interest in the stars and not even that, spend time with us and we'll make sure that you will fall in love with the cosmos because you yourself are made of stardust. So, even if you think that variable stars are demons trapped in a mysterious realm or that comets are omens of that war, we invite you to come and join us.

## Purpose of this wiki

Much like Hari Seldon’s Foundation, only with more telescopes and fewer intergalactic crises, the purpose of this wiki is to compile the ultimate Encyclopedia Galactica - a Wiki-nova of astronomical wonders.

As the astro-architects of tomorrow, we’re here to navigate the cosmos’ Wikipedia, penning tales of cosmic conquests and the odd alien faux pas. Our telescopes may be aimed at the heavens, but our wiki aims to make sure the knowledge cascades down to Earth with the grace of a well-choreographed meteor shower.

Join us on this interstellar journey, where black holes meet whiteboards, and supernovae become the pop stars of the cosmic charts. Because when it comes to the universe, ignorance is not bliss - it’s just a really bad orbit. Welcome to the Terminus Astronomy Club IITK Wiki, where the cosmos collides with academia, and the only dark ages are reserved for the space between our jokes!

## Contributing

Ever fancied yourself as a galactic grammar guru or a nebula-naming ninja? Buckle up your asteroid belt and join the cosmic carnival at the [Astronomy Club IITK](https://astroclubiitk.in)'s [Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/astroclubiitk/wiki)! This isn't just any repository; it's the open-source galaxy brain trust where even black holes can't keep secrets.

Contributing is easier than deciphering alien hieroglyphics - just imagine Wikipedia with a side of starlight and a dash of GitHub-flavoured quirkiness. Whether you're a code conjurer or a prose prodigy, our celestial circus welcomes all under our intergalactic big top.

Feel the gravitational pull of knowledge? Got a comet-worthy quip or a pulsar-powered pun? Fork us on [Github](https://github.com/astroclubiitk/wiki) and shout us a pull request; let's turn this wiki into a supernova of collective brilliance. Because, in the words of our favorite cosmic philosophers, "knowledge shared is knowledge squared." Join the comsic jamboree, where stars align and contributors shine - because when it comes to exploring the universe, we believe in open-sourcing the cosmos and sharing the astronomical love!
